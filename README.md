# MVP (Minimum Value Product) of DGL GNN Model Example Development

This project is designed for an MVP for GNN model development, and as a tutorial for new interns who will implement
GNN-related research papers with DGL.

GNN model used in this MVP comes from the paper of [CompositionGCN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03082), and with modification
for our education purpose. In this project, this is called CompGCN.

The Graph Data to Tackle
--------------------------
- Graph data (g): Homogenous graph
- Node features (n_feats): Could be any dimensions
- Edge features (e_feats): Only one dimension with 3 options, 0,1,or 2

The Model and Algorithm
-------------------------

For the modified CompGCN, the node embedding of the $k+th$ layer

The Structure of Example Files
--------------------------------

* **Section 1: Overview of Graph Neural Networks.** This section describes how graph
  neural networks operate, their underlying theory, and their advantages over alternative
  graph learning approaches. In addition, it describes various learning problems on graphs
  and shows how GNNs can be used to solve them.
